  <p>Founded in 2023, the The Bois Dynasty League is a dynasty league amongst a small group of friends. Each year, the managers compete to win the Bois Cup and avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>Through the first season it has become clear which teams have set their sights on an immediate glory and which teams have decided to look towards the future for their chance at a trophy. Only time will tell how these decisions pay off.</p>
  <p>While all of the team managers in this league are experienced in fantasy football, this is everyones first dynasty league. There has been a learning curve for everyone and varying strategies managers are using to run their teams shouold lead to an exciting future.</p>
  <p>Some managers built teams capable of winning it all now with established veterans while other managers have invested in young talent hoping for future breakouts. Some teams have traded future draft picks away to increase their chances of winning now and others have sold established players to accumulate more draft picks for upcoming years.</p>
  <p>The ultimate prize of this league is bragging rights for a year for the champion, but the extra $200 in the winners pocket will certainly be appreciated almost as much.</p>
